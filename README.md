> Hint: game has more than 3 levels :)

If the user has typed a difficulty level higher than 3, the game will tell him that he has found a secret level. The higher the difficulty level, the higher the number from the larger gap will have to be guessed.

### Number of attempts

After the user has guessed the guessed number, the game displays his number of attempts. A 1 is added to the number of attempts when the user has entered the correct number.

> The number is considered correct only when it is within the given difficulty.
